Possible next steps:
- improve performance for transcribing speed and converting to flac & 1 mono channel
- allow users to edit transcript to improve accuracy
- button/command that returns whole transcript and when you click on word, it takes you to timestamp in video source (i.e. onClick <text>)
- limit transcript box to length of video screen and implement scrolling
- rename to better explain value e.g. VideoScribe
- ask for donations from users after transcription is done or when they want to exit pages
- option for them to upload video to transcribe
- input box at top of video page for them to enter new url
